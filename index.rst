SkyGrid Overview
===================================
SkyGrid is a platform for handling projects that require connecting up thousands of devices to the cloud for centralized management with an API for the physical world. SkyGrid makes development for the real world easy.

Whilst you may be familiar with other Internet of Things (IoT) platforms, Skygrid is different, it's more than just an IoT platform - it's an entire backend for your project. User and device management, fine grained security controls, data storage, and more can be managed by Skygrid.

To get started, first check out the :doc:`concepts-guide`. The :doc:`up-and-running-in-five` guide will then step you through creating a project, device and simple application all through the Skygrid platform.
